This project aims at creating HTML5 Renderer, Reference HTML5 Browser and HTML5 Rendering components which can be embedded in other applications using pure Java.

The name is inspired by the book "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" by renowned author Richard Bach. The protagonist in that book is a seagull who plans for a significant achievement and achieves it through perseverance. This project takes J from Jonathan in the name jseagull.

In the technology world most of the Java projects tent to use J as the first letter of the project to signify Java as the used technology which also applies to this project as it plans to implement a Java component capable of rendering HTML5 pages just as they are rendered in browsers In other words this project will create a pure java implementation of web component and also become a reference pure java web browser using that component.
